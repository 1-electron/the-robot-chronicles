## march 2020: the nursery

the guts of the old automotive plant were hastily resurrected. now they were sleek, gun metal banks, with its innards lined by fiber optic cables, power, and connectivity. 

this colossal monster attracted laborers from all over. it wasnt too long ago that teaching was considered an underpaid and overworked profession; now it attracted the best and brightest graduates. 

of course, teaching robots in this gigantic nursery could be exhausting and mind numbing, but it paid well with decent benefits.
