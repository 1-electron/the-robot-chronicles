## march 2020: the nursery

the guts of the old automotive plant were hastily resurrected. within two years, they were sleek, gun metal banks, with its innards lined by fiber optic, power, and connectivity. 

this colossal nursery attracted laborers from all over. it wasnt too long ago that teaching was considered an underpaid and overworked profession; now it attracted the best and brightest graduates. 

of course, teaching robots could be exhausting and mind numbing, but it paid well with decent benefits, and supported the middle class lifestyle.
