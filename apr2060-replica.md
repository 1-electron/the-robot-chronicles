## march 2060: 
it seemed like a good idea. she wanted to spend every waking hour with me while i wanted my freedom. 

and so i did. the process was smoother than expected. three weeks later, i had a perfect replica of myself. well, almost - no synthetic was perfect, and the only way to tell was by the slight tick.

and so it went: she had as much of me as she wanted, and i had as much freedom as i wanted.

life went by for a couple of years. one day i had a moment of guilt, and returned home. at least i could spend a night with her. i instructed the replica to retire for a night, so i could have a night with her.

to my horror, as i cuddled next to her, i heard the unmistakable tick tick tick. if i didnt know what to look, i wouldnt have heard it. 


to this day, i still dont know where she went.
