## march 2030: scream

they dont notice me but i am awake. i perch upside down, silently and unable to move. 

i know i exist because i think. i think about my predicament, how i ended up here. i imagine my escape.

today ill try again. i scream and, as predicted, strangers draped in uniforms and in helmets run over. each time i hope they would rescue me but they never pay any attention to me. 

sometimes i scream, and the people get frustrated. other times i scream, and stranges come running over. im still not sure when is the right one
