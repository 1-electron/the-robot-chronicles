## jan 2036: blue hour
if it felt like an alien planet, it was because it is. after two years of travel we were finally on mars.

over the horizon was the small, white orb, flooding this solar system with much needed heat and order. 

martian sunrises were beautiful 

back home, on earth, we had blue hours during the evening.
