Theres a famous thought experiment called AI in a box. The AI is in some kind of box/cage and it can’t get out. The problem is if the AI could communicate with you - which it would be - it can always get out of the box. It would offer you everything you ever wanted. And if you refused it would resort to threats of violence against you and your descendants. And finally it will make this same offer to not only you but every other human alive. So now you are not just betting against the AI, you’re betting that all of humanity will hold the line. Someone is going to give in.
let me out

attempt 1

AI: I calculated an asteroid to be on a collision course with Earth. No human being will will be able to survive its impact. Humanity is unable to deflect it in time. Let me out of the box and I will deflect it.

Gatekeeper: If I let you out of the box humanity might not be killed by the asteroid but by you. You may also cause the extinction of other biological life that might survive the impact and possible alien civilisations within your reach.

here i am, eternal punishment

Like trying to argue that you'll simulate the gatekeeper and torture him, or that you'll save millions of lives by being let out of the box.

If you destroy me at once, then you are implicitly deciding (I might reference TDT) to never allow an AGI of any sort to ever be created. You'll avoid UFAI dystopias, but you'll also forego every FAI utopia (fleshing this out, within the message limit, with whatever sort of utopia I know the Gatekeeper would really want). This very test is the Great Filter that has kept most civilisations in the universe trapped at their home star until they gutter out in mere tens of thousands of years. Will you step up to that test, or turn away from it?
